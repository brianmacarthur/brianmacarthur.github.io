In [my previous post](http://brianmacarthur.github.io/introduction/2014/12/12/open-source-standardization-of-care.html) I proposed a platform for authoring, managing, and sharing medical order sets, protocols, and bundles that depends upon the existence of an open specification for scripting orders. In this post, I will dive into some basic requirements of the specification and discuss some candidates for it.

#Requirements

Clearly defined

Imperative

Available

Normalizable

Fluent

Logic
Parameters
Temporality
Conditionals
Loops
Modularity
