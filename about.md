I am employed as an obstetrician but enjoy programming in my spare time. There are many other hobbies that I'm sure I would find satisfying, but I appreciate that this one in particular has such a minimal equipment requirement. My workshop can be as simple as a notebook and a pen and is never more complicated than a home office.

I was raised in rural Oregon with 2 older brothers by a saint of a mother. We were poor then but loved. And though I haven't experienced poverty in years, my experiences with it as a boy continue to leave a not entirely negative imprint on my life as a man.

Then I was lucky enough to attend an exclusive private college, where I studied linguistics and made some wonderful friends before returning to Oregon without a clear sense of where I should go from there. It fortunately wasn't long before I came across a fork in my road. I got a nasty external ear infection while working as a patina artist at a nearby bronze foundry and was jealous of the knowledge employed by a rural family practitioner in treating my malady. With the encouragement of a few friends and family, and in spite of discouragement from many others, I decided to become a doctor.

Three years passed between my decision to go to medical school and my first class. They were spent completing prerequisites, taking the MCAT, and working in a biochemistry lab, first as a dishwasher, then as a research assistant. There I gained an appreciation for the tools and techniques that allow us to peer into a sub-microscopic universe. That is also where I first recognized that I would benefit from knowing my way around a computer.

Starting from scratch, I bought components and put together my first Windows box, a 400MHz Celeron beast if I remember correctly. I taught myself some HTML basics and utilized Adobe's excellent tutorials on Flash and Photoshop to weasel my way into a short term graphic design gig during the first dotcom boom. Once at work, I dabbled in whatever projects I could and got a nice taste of the startup world before starting medical school. It was great.
